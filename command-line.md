Without using jargon, how would you describe the command line to a lay person (e.g. your mum)?

if computer was a pantry you would type in its command line things like 'move spaghetti from top shelf to bottom shelf' or 'open a brown spice box and see what spices are inside'

 List 10 terminal commands and in plain english (i.e. with minimal technical jargon) describe what they do.

 pwd
 see what pantry section you currently are in

 cd
 allows you to go to a different place in your pantry. you can choose which

 ls
 the section pantry that you are in has things in it. ls allows you to see the list of what things these are

 mkdir
 allows you to create a new compartment in your pantry. for example - your gluten free aunt is visiting so you're going to need a section for gluten free food

 touch
 this place that i'm in in my pantry needs to have a new thing in it. with 'touch' i can choose what kind of thing and it appears. This is a magical pantry. let this new thing be jam for example.

cp
allows you to copy your things. cp jam gives you another jam in the same place

 rm
 allows you to remove things that are no longer needed. removing the other jam leaves you with only the original jam. the other jam disappeared

 mv
 allows you to move things from shelf to shelf in your pantry

head
allows you to quickly see what's on top of your thing. for example with jam it's as if someone opened the jam jar and stuck their finger in the jam and told you what they found.

tail
it is the same as head but gives you information about the bottom of your object.
